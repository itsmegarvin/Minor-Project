In summary, the automatic car parking system marks a significant advancement in the field of parking management.
The integration of various components, including ESP32 Cam for car detection, infrared sensors (IR) for the parking
 slots, also the use of servo motors at entry and exit section. Finally the use of RTC to calculate time and duration along
 with relative cost.This integration of these components has resulted in an efficient management of the parking system.

Our project successfully achieved its objective of creating a automated car parking system capable of calculating time duration and 
relative cost of individual vehicles, displaying the information of the slots to the users.Also we have created an mobile application 
of our system using which we can get the information related to our parking system. Through meticulous design and testing, our system 
meets the highest standard of functionality and reliability.

The user experience was a primary consideration throughout the development process with a focus of providing users a reliable and 
automated parking system. The inclusion of the lcd display at the entry section ensures the information will be provided to the users.

This project is a prototype of the parking system which in future will be enhanced and its significance marks the initiation of the
automated vehicle system throughout the world.
